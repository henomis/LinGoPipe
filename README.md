# Overview

**LinGoose** is a powerful Go framework for developing Large Language Model (LLM) based applications using pipelines. It is designed to be a complete solution and provides multiple components, including Prompts, Templates, Chat, Output Decoders, LLM, Pipelines, and Memory. With **LinGoose**, you can interact with LLM AI through prompts and generate complex templates. Additionally, it includes a chat feature, allowing you to create chatbots. The Output Decoders component enables you to extract specific information from the output of the LLM, while the LLM interface allows you to send prompts to various AI, such as the ones provided by OpenAI. You can chain multiple LLM steps together using Pipelines and store the output of each step in Memory for later retrieval. **LinGoose** also includes a Document component, which is used to store text, and a Loader component, which is used to load Documents from various sources. Finally, it includes TextSplitters, which are used to split text or Documents into multiple parts, Embedders, which are used to embed text or Documents into embeddings, and Indexes, which are used to store embeddings and documents and to perform searches.

# Components

**LinGoose** is composed of multiple components, each one with its own purpose.

# Usage

Please refer to the documentation at [lingoose.io](https://lingoose.io/docs/) to understand how to use LinGoose. If you prefer the üëâ [examples directory](examples/) contains a lot of examples üöÄ.
However, here is a **powerful** example of what **LinGoose** is capable of:

_Talk is cheap. Show me the [code](examples/)._ - Linus Torvalds

```go
package main

import (
	"context"

	openaiembedder "github.com/henomis/lingoose/embedder/openai"
	"github.com/henomis/lingoose/index/option"
	simplevectorindex "github.com/henomis/lingoose/index/simpleVectorIndex"
	"github.com/henomis/lingoose/llm/openai"
	"github.com/henomis/lingoose/loader"
	qapipeline "github.com/henomis/lingoose/pipeline/qa"
	"github.com/henomis/lingoose/textsplitter"
)

func main() {
	docs, _ := loader.NewPDFToTextLoader("./kb").WithPDFToTextPath("/opt/homebrew/bin/pdftotext").WithTextSplitter(textsplitter.NewRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(2000, 200)).Load(context.Background())
	index := simplevectorindex.New("db", ".", openaiembedder.New(openaiembedder.AdaEmbeddingV2))
	index.LoadFromDocuments(context.Background(), docs)
	qapipeline.New(openai.NewChat().WithVerbose(true)).WithIndex(index).Query(context.Background(), "What is the NATO purpose?", option.WithTopK(1))
}
```

This is the _famous_ 4-lines **lingoose** knowledge base chatbot. ü§ñ
